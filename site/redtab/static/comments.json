Programming bootcamps exist and are profitable for a reason, too. BUT, you're right, although i'd add that college classes may at times make it easier to learn simply because they're structured and follow a curriculum, and anyone who's done any language understands how hard it is to know where you should start first--which is why I advised most people on here to go for the Harvard CS50 course to get an introduction while also getting some form of certificate that, for $90, can only help them in the future.

I think it's a cool concept, but I  also think that doing that and the Harvard course would be a smart choice.

I know a couple programmers who couldn&amp;#39;t stand being in a college classroom, found it extremely boring and that it more or less hindering their ability to move forward and do more &amp;quot;meaningful&amp;quot; things with the time and money they were spending. So, they dropped out. To them, getting the basics down and working on projects was the most intuitive and &lt;em&gt;easiest&lt;/em&gt; way to attain the skill level they needed to get a job. Those people have jobs and are doing fine now. But my point is that everybody&amp;#39;s different. There&amp;#39;s a reason why Google hires more and more college drop-outs who&amp;#39;ve learned the skill elsewhere. Programming bootcamps exist and are profitable for a reason, too. BUT, you&amp;#39;re right, although i&amp;#39;d add that college classes may at times make it easier to learn simply because they&amp;#39;re structured and follow a curriculum, and anyone who&amp;#39;s done any language understands how hard it is to know where you should start first--which is why I advised most people on here to go for the Harvard CS50 course to get an introduction while also getting some form of certificate that, for $90, can only help them in the future. The title of the post to me was more or less saying &amp;quot;teach yourself how to code through this class without going to college&amp;quot;. I think it&amp;#39;s a cool concept, but I  also think that doing that and the Harvard course would be a smart choice. Understanding the fundamentals is the hardest part, and even if they have a degree in something other field, the CS50 course will only help them and give them something relevant to put on their resume instead of just saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m self-taught.

I thought it was a very good course and I learned a lot from it, but I don&amp;#39;t know how well it works in a self-taught model.  If it helps, I only attended maybe half of the lectures and still learned everything just fine, so I&amp;#39;d say there&amp;#39;s a good chance it works well for self-study.
